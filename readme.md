## Personal Boilerplate Sample Template

#### Description
This is a personal boilerplate that intends to help myself set up a new project. It also includes a really small project.

The boilerplate intends to cover the following stuff, they might come from my own other repos or other open-sources, some of them haven't been finished yet.

- Swagger API
- Laravel Passport
- Vuejs
- Laravel Nova
- Cron job management
- Module-based structure

I am not going to write document on it, because the project is self-intended and may change over the time.

This is also a demo that how I work for Laravel industries.
